# 🌦️ Weather App (Vanilla JavaScript)

Hi everyone! 👋  

I built this **Weather App** using **Vanilla JavaScript**, without any external frameworks or libraries.  
It’s a simple and functional web app that displays real-time weather information in a clean, minimal interface.

---

## 🧠 About the Project

This app displays:
- 🌤️ **Weather Icon** — representing the current weather condition  
- 🌡️ **Temperature** — shown in Celsius (click to switch to Fahrenheit)  
- ☁️ **Description** — short weather summary (e.g., *clear sky*)  
- 📍 **Location** — user’s city and country (e.g., *London, GB*)

While building it, I learned how to:
- Work with **APIs** to fetch real-time data  
- Use **JavaScript DOM manipulation** to dynamically update content  
- Handle **user interactions** like click events and temperature conversion
